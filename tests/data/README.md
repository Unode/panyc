Data files were generated by running the vpn binary and forwarding output to a
file:

    /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn > 00-server_not_running.data


The files were then edited to have output lines starting with ``>`` or ``<``
for output (produced by vpn server) or input (produced by vpn client)
respectively.
