# Running tests

Ensure dependencies are installed and simply run:

    ./run_all -v

## Disclaimer

Current tests don't actually run against the real client.
For practical reasons we use a dummy client with communication transcripts generated by the real client.
This may break in the future if the client changes its messages or any of the communication steps.
